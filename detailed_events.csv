An authentication package is a DLL that encapsulates a given form of authentication, such as NTLM or Kerberos. The Local Security Authority calls into the appropriate authentication package during the logon process to find out if the user is authentic. 

Although a third party can develop an authentication package, few do so, except for smart card and token manufacturers. The only authentication package logged by Windows Server 2008 is C:\Windows\system32\msv1_0.dll : MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0 which is just one of the authentication options supported by Windows (See 514 for a list of standard authentication packages on Windows Server 2003). The other authentication options supported by Windows Server 2008 appear to now be part of a larger package called a security package. See 4622.  From MSDN: ""A security package that functions as an authentication package and implements the functionality required by SSPI is called a security support provider/authentication package (SSP/AP).""

The security implication of event 4610, realistically, is low. Although a rogue package could cause great harm by stealing credentials at the time of logon, the effort required in developing and installing a rogue authentication package is significant.","An authentication package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority.
This authentication package will be used to authenticate logon attempts.

A logon process is a trusted part of the operating system and handles the overall logon function for different logon methods including incoming RAS connections, RunAs, interactive logons initiated by CtrlAltDel, and network logons (as in drive mappings). 

Because logon processes are such trusted functions, a rogue logon process would be a devastating security breach--but an improbable one, given the effort and skill required.

This event signals the end of a logon session and can be correlated back to the logon event 4624 using the Logon ID.

For network connections (such as to a file server), it will appear that users log on and off many times a day. This phenomenon is caused by the way the Server service terminates idle connections. 

If a user turns off his/her computer, Windows does not have an opportunity to log the logoff event until the system restarts. Therefore, some logoff events are logged much later than the time at which they actually occur. 

ANONYMOUS LOGONs are routine events on Windows networks.

Microsoft's comments: 
This event does not necessarily indicate the time that a user has stopped using a system. For example, if the computer is shut down or loses network connectivity it may not record a logoff event at all.

                            Failure","This event is logged on domain controllers only and both success and failure instances of this event are logged. 

At the beginning of the day when a user sits down at his or her workstation and enters his domain username and password, the workstation contacts a local DC and requests a TGT. If the username and password are correct and the user account passes status and restriction checks, the DC grants the TGT and logs event ID 4768 (authentication ticket granted).   

If the ticket request fails Windows will either log this event, 4768 or 4771 with failure as the type.

The User field for this event (and all other events in the Audit account logon event category) doesn't help you determine who the user was; the field always reads N/A. Rather look at the Account Information: fields, which identify the user who logged on and the user account's DNS suffix. The User ID field provides the SID of the account. 

Windows logs other instances of event ID 4768 when a computer in the domain needs to authenticate to the DC typically when a workstation boots up or a server restarts. In these instances, you'll find a computer name in the User Name and fields. Computer generated kerberos events are always identifiable by the $ after the computer account's name.

At the beginning of the day when a user sits down at his or her workstation and enters his domain username and password, the workstation contacts a local DC and requests a TGT. If the username and password are correct and the user account passes status and restriction checks, the DC grants the TGT and logs event ID  4768 (authentication ticket granted).   

If the ticket request fails Windows will either log this event, failure 4771, or 4768 if the problem arose during ""pre-authentication"".  In Windows Kerberos, password verification takes place during pre-authentication.

The User field for this event (and all other events in the Audit account logon event category) doesn't help you determine who the user was; the field always reads N/A. Rather look at the Account Information: fields, which identify the user who logged on and the user account's DNS suffix. The User ID field provides the SID of the account. 

Windows logs other instances of event ID 4768 when a computer in the domain needs to authenticate to the DC typically when a workstation boots up or a server restarts.

Event 513 is an important security event: Any operating system is defenseless while it's down. You should document system shutdowns in a written log that monitors who shut down which system and for how long. You can determine the duration of a system shutdown by checking for a previous event 512 for the system. If no event 512 appears, look for the most recent event 517.",Windows is shutting down. All logon sessions will be terminated by this shutdown.
Windows,514,An authentication package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority,https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=514,"['Windows Server 2000\r\n                        \r\n                            Windows 2003', 'XP']",System,Success,"Event 514 is logged once at startup for each authentication package on the system. 

An authentication package is a DLL that encapsulates a given form of authentication, such as NTLM or Kerberos. The Local Security Authority calls into the appropriate authentication package during the logon process to find out if the user is authentic. 

Although a third party can develop an authentication package, few do so. The standard packages that come with Windows Server 2003 are as follows:","An authentication package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority. This authentication package will be used to authenticate logon attempts. 
Authentication Package Name: C:\WINDOWS\system32\kerberos.dll : Kerberos."

A logon process is a trusted part of the operating system and handles the overall logon function for different logon methods including incoming RAS connections, RunAs, interactive logons initiated by CtrlAltDel, and network logons (as in drive mappings). 

Because logon processes are such trusted functions, a rogue logon process would be a devastating security breach--but an improbable one, given the effort and skill required. 

Standard logon process for Windows Server 2003:","A trusted logon process has registered with the Local Security Authority. This logon process will be trusted to submit logon requests.

(See event 528 for a chart of logon types) However, this event is not dependably logged, for a variety of reasons. In a nutshell, there is no way to reliably track user logoff events in the Windows environment. 

Note: Beginning with Windows Server 2003, logoffs of logon type 2 sessions are logged with event 551. 

For network connections (such as to a file server), it will appear that users log on and off many times a day. This phenomenon is caused by the way the Server service terminates idle connections. 

If a user turns off his/her computer, Windows does not have an opportunity to log the logoff event until the system restarts. Therefore, some logoff events are logged much later than the time at which they actually occur. 

Sometimes Windows simply doesn't log event 538. 

Microsoft's comments: 

This event does not necessarily indicate the time that a user has stopped using a system. For example, if the computer is shut down or loses network connectivity it may not record a logoff event at all.",No example available

Win2000 

Event 565 allows you to track changes to Active Directory objects down to the property level. While Account Management provides more useful auditing for changes to users, groups and computers, Directory Service Access events are the only way to monitor potentially far reaching effects of changes to organizational units, group policy objects, domains and site related objects. 

Event 565 is similar to event 560 but is limited to recording open events on Active Directory objects. Event 565 is therefore only logged on domain controllers. 

Auditing on desired container and leaf objects must be enabled for event 565 to be logged. Open properties dialog of object, select Security tab, click Advanced and select Auditing tab. Event 565 allows you to track new objects created in AD, changes to existing object and deletes. 

Object Type specifies the class object as specified in the schema for this forest. Common object types: 
user 
group 
gpContainer (group policy object) 
dnsDomain (domain) 
organizational unit 

Object Name: X500 distinguished name of the object. 

Primary fields: always correspond to the directory service process and domain controller account. 

Client fields: identify the user (usually some level of an administrator) that accessed the object. 

Accesses: Identify the permissions requested by user/program to the object. These accesses directly correspond to the object level and property level permissions you see in the access control list of the associated object in Active Directory. Write Property and Read Property accesses will be followed by the actual properties written to or read. 

Object types and property names can be cryptic. Use the Active Directory Schema Management MMC snap-in to understand the meaning. 

Write_DAC indicates the user/program attempted to change the permissions on the object. 

You will only see event 565 on domain controllers.

You will normally see event 576 in close succession to logon event 528 or 540.

Logon ID: corresponds to the Logon ID of the preceding event 528 or 540. 

Do not confuse user rights (aka privileges) with object permissions despite the fact that MS documentation uses these terms inconsistently. 

Most user rights are not logged by event 576 and instead are logged at the actual time they are exercised using either event 577 or 578.. 

Some of these high-volume rights can be logged each time they are exercised if you enable FullPrivilegeAuditing. To enable auditing of these privileges, add the following key

On Windows Server 2000, this event is logged for the ""SeSecurityPrivilege"" whenever the security log is viewed or cleared because these operations require the use of the ""Manage auditing and security log right"" (aka SeSecurityPrivilege). For some reason Windows Server 2003, in the same situation, does not log this event. Occurrences for SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege also appear however the object handle can't be found in any other events in the log so there is no way to identify the object that the ""client"" user took ownership of.

This event gets logged twice (duplicate) by the domain controller. The DC also logs an event 620 along with this event. The DC logs this event for both new trusted and trusting domains. There is no way to make a distinction. 

If directory service access auditing is turned on, the DC also logs an event 565 (object opened) where the object service is DS and the object type is trustedDomain. Trusted/trusting domain is not identified.

Win2003 

Unlike Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003 only logs this event once for each new trust. Although the description says ""new *trusted* domain"" this event gets logged for both trusted and trusting relationships. Note trust type, trust direction, etc. in descripiton. 

Also accompanying this is an event ID 565 - if directory service auditing is turned on. 565 identifies the event as a ""creat child"", trustedDomain event and supplies the distinquished name of the new domain (e.g. CN=SouthAmerica, CN=System,DC=elm, DC=local) 

Trust Directions 
1 - Trusted (the domain where this event was logged accepts the identity of users of the new domain) 
2 - Trusting ( (the new domain accepts the identity of users of the domain where this event was logged) 
3 - 2-way (mutual trust) 

Trust Type and Attributes refer to whether the trust relationship is an NT 4.0 legacy trust, Kerberos realm trust or a forest or domain trust with another active directory domain and whether the trust is transitive or not. 

SID filtering involves whether SID history from the external domain is used in the local domain.

W2k logs frequent occurrences of this event even if you haven't changed your password policy. Each time Win2K applies Group Policy, it doesn't check to see whether the new and old policies are actually different. You can ignore event ID 643. 

Win2003 

Unlike w2k, w3 properly logs this event only when the password or lockout policy or domain mode changes. Additionally the actual settings changed are identified with their new values under Change Attributes.

Password Properties = ""Password must meet complexity requirements"" and ""Store password using reversible encryption for all users in the domain""

Win2000 

This event gets logged on domain controllers only. 

At the beginning of the day when a user sits down at his or her workstation and enters his domain username and password, the workstation contacts a local DC and requests a TGT. If the username and password are correct and the user account passes status and restriction checks, the DC grants the TGT and logs event ID 672 (authentication ticket granted). The User field for this event (and all other events in the Audit account logon event category) doesn't help you determine who the user was; the field always reads SYSTEM. Rather look at the User Name and Supplied Realm Name fields, which identify the user who logged on and the user account's DNS suffix. The User ID field provides the same information in NT style. 

Client Address identifies the IP address of the workstation from which the user logged on. 

W2k logs other instances of event ID 672 when a computer in the domain needs to authenticate to the DC typically when a workstation boots up or a server restarts. In these instances, you'll find a computer name in the User Name and User ID fields. Computer generated kerberos events are always identifiable by the $ after the computer account's name. 

Win2003 

This event is logged on domain controllers only and both success and failure instances of this event are logged.

In W2k failed authentication ticket requests generate event ID 676 but in W3 this event is used for both success and failed requests. The reason for the authentication failure is specified in Result Code. 

Microsoft's Comments: 

Does not contain any additional information if audit details from logon events 528 and 540 are already being collected. This event records that a Kerberos TGT was granted, actual access will not occur until a service ticket is granted, which is audited by Event 673.

Whereas event ID 672 lets you track initial logons through the granting of TGTs, this lets you monitor the granting of service tickets. Service tickets are obtained whenever a user or computer accesses a server on the network. For example, when a user maps a drive to a file server, the resulting service ticket request generates event ID 673 on the DC. 

User Name and User Domain identify the user. 
Service Name corresponds the computer name of the server the user accessed. 
Client Address specifies the IP address where the user resides.

By reviewing each of your DC Security logs for this event and failure code, you can track every domain logon attempt that failed as a result of a bad password. In addition to providing the username and domain name, the event provides the IP address of the system from which the logon attempt originated. 

Win2K also logs event ID 675 when a user attempts to use a different username (i.e., a username other than the one he or she used for the current workstation logon) to connect to a server. For example, a user might try to use the Connect using a different user name feature to use someone else's account to map a drive to a server. 

This event can be logged for a few other reasons which are specified in the failure code. All Kerberos event failure codes correspond to the error codes defined by the Kerberos standard (RFC 1510). Click here for an explanation of failure codes. 

Recommended response for failed instances of this event: 

Check the User ID field. Most events generated by computer accounts are safe to ignore. Determine the reason for the authentication failure by checking Failure Code. TGT failures are usually due to a bad password or time synchronization between workstation and domain controller. If Failure Code indicates a bad password, how many failures exist for the same account? Look at the client IP address. Is an innocent user error or malicious attack indicated. If practical contact user regarding their recent logon attempts.","Pre-authentication failed:

Sometimes an attempt to acquire a service ticket fails even though the DC successfully authenticated the user and granted a TGT. In this case, Win2K logs event ID 677 (service ticket request failed) with a variety of failure codes depending on the situation. See event ID 675 for a list of failure codes.

Common example: user tries to connect from Win2K+ workstation to NT server. Generates event 677 with Failure Code 7. The workstation first asks the DC to grant a Kerberos service ticket, but that fails because the NT server doesn't support Kerberos. Thus, the DC logged event ID 677 with Failure Code 7. This type of error is transparent to the user because the workstation immediately falls back to using NTLM.

When DC successfully authenticates a user via NTLM (instead of Kerberos), the DC logs this event. This specifies which user account who logged on (Account Name) as well as the client computer's name from which the user initiated the logon in the Workstation field.
